# rotom4j
Java/Processing Library for viewing/editing/extracting Nintendo Nitro and Pokemon NDS files

## Why?
* I wanted to be able to interactively unpack NARC files
* I wanted to understand the code
* I wanted to look at the binary source
* I didn't want to tussle with Swing
* 2D/3D support in the same program (future)
* Git compare support (future)


## Supported Files
For a list of currently supported files, see [here](/docs/files/Supported Files.md)
